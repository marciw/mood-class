# Audio Classification of Emotional Inputs

My master's thesis at Columbia University explores the intersection of speech language processing and journalism: How can speech or audio analysis be used to further a written piece?<br>

In order to partly answer this question, I utilized [pyAudioAnalysis](https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis) to build a classifier that would categorize short utterances into
one of five emotional categories: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness.<p>

The training data that I used for classifier came from the [CREMA-D](https://github.com/CheyneyComputerScience/CREMA-D).
